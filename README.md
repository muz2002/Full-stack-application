# Employee Management System

The full-stack application is a robust employee management system designed for seamless interaction and efficient handling of employee data. Utilizing React for the frontend, users can easily navigate through a well-organized interface that displays a comprehensive list of employees. The frontend allows for the addition of new employees, enabling users to input relevant details and seamlessly submit the information. To ensure data accuracy and real-time updates, the application leverages Spring Boot on the backend. This powerful framework manages server-side operations, facilitating smooth communication between the frontend and the MySQL database employed for data storage. The system not only supports the addition of new employees but also provides functionality for updating existing employee information and removing employees when necessary. Overall, this full-stack application ensures a user-friendly experience, leveraging the strengths of React, Spring Boot, and MySQL to deliver a dynamic and efficient employee management solution.
